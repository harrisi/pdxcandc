  🧑‍💻 Software Developers, you may find value at our meetup doing one or
  none of the following: look for a better job, meet developers and make
  friends, validate the feasibility of an ambitious side project, get help with
  my coding blocker or homework, gain insight and awareness into a company
  you're interviewing for, learn about other professions involving code, join a
  vibrant online discord community, and/or hangout to sip coffee in a perfect
  space with friendly people.
