Who is this meetup group for?

🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑
We're a Community. Our attendees feel like they're a part of the group. This group is not
run by a company -- it is run by a group of individual community members.
📈🔍 Of Software Developers, new and old. Or for people who work with them or want to
become one.
🐣🐓 At Any Level. Whether you're aspiring, newer, or more experienced.

What do we do at these events?
💬 Discussion. Many attendees come with questions, ideas, or strategies to discuss.
🕸 Networking. Many people come to meet people; that's enough reason on its own.
🫲🏻 Support. Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer
support. We encourage it!

Many people come with questions, ideas, or strategies to discuss — and many others just come
to meet people! Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and
peer-support friends — and we encourage attendees to form relationships like these.


Near the beginning of the event(9:15 am), we do form a circle
Organizers and venues will first do announcements, group updates, and logistics.

Then, going around in a circle - you will state:
Your Name
What you can help others with
What you would like help with
Job opportunities you're hiring for OR announce that you are looking for one. If none, that's cool.
